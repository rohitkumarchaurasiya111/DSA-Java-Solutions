//Job Sequencing Problem

// We have an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit if the job is finished before the deadline. It is also given that every job takes a single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. Maximize the total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.
// // Sample Input 1:
// JobID Deadline Profit
// a           4       20
// b           1       10
// C           1       40
// d           1       30
// Sample Output 1: c, a
